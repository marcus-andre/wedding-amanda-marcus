# Amanda & Marcus - Wedding Website

Amanda & Marcus wedding website is my idea of website for engaged couples who are getting merried and they want to share information with their guest quickly and virtually.

The main objective of this website is to confirm attendance and control the guest list, provide information about the wedding (where the ceremony and celebration will be, with date, time and location) and show a little bit story of each one and how they met.
